#### Introduction
The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.

#### What Is the Least Squares Method?

Each point of data represents the relationship between a known independent variable and an unknown dependent variable. This method is commonly used by statisticians and traders who want to identify trading opportunities and trends.
